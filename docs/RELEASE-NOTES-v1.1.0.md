# Body Change NG v1.1.0

Body, skin, and NPC-rule compatibility update — 2026-09-04.

### Body presets and mixed-body installations

- Body presets now target an absolute shape across the compatible family's slider set. Omitted XML sliders target zero; repeated preview, confirmation, and NPC distribution no longer add the same shape on top of an existing one.
- Uses BCNG-owned compensation instead of globally clearing morphs. Other mods' morph keys are not deleted, and the preview and committed/NPC paths keep separate ownership.
- Detects CBBE 3BA and UBE per actor from the loaded skin/head evidence. Preset set and Group metadata drive XML classification; ambiguous and multi-family presets retain safe display fallbacks.
- Keeps user-selected rule pools intact; runtime body/skin selection checks the matched actor's sex and known family. Outfit-related names are not blanket-excluded from the body catalog.

### Skin coverage and material routing

- Corrects male skin-path handling and hand/foot targeting, including multi-slot skin armor whose geometry is not found through the first biped slot.
- Partial skin packs work in preview, confirmation, and NPC distribution. Only supplied body/hand/foot/face parts and diffuse, normal, subsurface, or specular channels are replaced; missing values keep the underlying texture without cross-part or cross-channel substitution.
- Adds per-actor UBE 2.0 Body/Head atlas routing and female/male Argonian and Khajiit skin matching, including matching tail geometry.
- Applies femaleold and humanoid race-specific face-normal files only to matching actors and only where files exist. Astrid/Afflicted-specific textures and tint-mask DDS inside BodySkin are excluded from body-skin application.
- Routes CBBE 3BA femalebody_etc_v2_1 to its shared vagina/anal atlas and BHUNP/UNP BakaUNP/VaginalAnalCanal2 to matching vagina/anal/canal geometry, separately from regular body textures.
- Supports optional SOS Smurf Average, VectorPlexus Regular, and VectorPlexus Muscular slot-52 textures from the skin pack's original SOS directory. Addon/race/elder variants follow the live material; Muscular uses the shipped Regular-channel inheritance where appropriate.
- Separates known UBE/conventional player tint packs while retaining safe fallbacks for uncertain family detection. Tint remains a player-only feature.

### NPC distribution and performance

- Adds keyword, class, and combat-style rule targets alongside existing conditions. Faction dropdowns include unnamed forms using EditorID/plugin/local-ID labels.
- Stores faction, race, keyword, class, and combat-style targets as plugin plus local FormID in schema 4. Existing schema-3 rules remain readable and are migrated on save.
- Preserves the eight starter exclusions: custom followers and elders of both sexes remain body-only exclusions; Argonians and Khajiit of both sexes remain skin-only exclusions.
- Coalesces automatic actor/equipment work in both normal and performance modes, defers RaceMenu partition updates, and skips unnecessary outfit-morph rebuilds. Performance mode adds an extra scheduling interval.
- Moves the first loaded-NPC pass out of the serialization/RaceMenu/overlay load-callback burst by two game-task turns. No recurring file scan or timer is added; catalog-derived slider sets are cached.

### Migration, UI, and release

- Repairs visible non-UBE RaceMenu .jslot files with obsolete BodyChange.esp face HeadParts after the legacy plugin is removed. Creates an adjacent backup and prefers the available High Poly Head target, otherwise the vanilla target; UBE custom-head presets are preserved.
- Renames the main catalog tabs to Body Presets, Body Skins, and Tint Masks; refreshes Korean and English release documentation.
- Retains existing settings, co-save identities, ownership namespaces, and the BodyChangeNGdistribution.json filename. Version 1.1.0 does not rename or reset them.

## Updating from 1.0.0

- Close Skyrim before replacing the DLL.
- Back up your active `Data\SKSE\Plugins\BodyChangeNGdistribution.json` and settings, including any MO2 Overwrite/profile copy. Install the new main archive without replacing those personal files with the starter JSON.
- Keep custom BodySkin, TintMask, and SliderPresets content, preferably in a separate MO2 mod.
- Existing schema-3 and schema-4 rules can be loaded; saving writes schema 4. Co-save identifiers and the JSON filename are unchanged.
- Refresh affected catalogs after adding or changing files. Use the NPC editor's apply-now action when you want edited rules reevaluated for loaded NPCs.

## Files

- `Body Change NG v1.1.0.zip` — MO2-ready main archive.
- `Body Change NG v1.1.0 Source.zip` — corresponding source, build script, pinned vendored dependencies, and licenses.
- `SHA256SUMS-v1.1.0.txt` — archive checksums.

## Validation boundaries

Validation: Release build and ten regression test executables. File/NIF evidence and automated tests cover routing and state logic; in-game atlas appearance, collision behavior, OverlayFix crash compatibility, and stutter-free gameplay are not certified by these tests.

This is not a physics/collision-engine replacement. Existing body/outfit geometry and compatible morph data still determine the rendered result.
