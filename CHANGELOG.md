# Changelog

All notable public changes to Body Change NG are documented here.

## 1.1.1 — 2026-09-05

### Direct selection and skin updates

- Gives direct body, skin, and tint selections a reserved processing opportunity within the existing frame budget, while preserving service for automatic NPC distribution.
- Promotes the selected actor's required follow-up work without reordering that actor's preview, confirmation, or skin updates.
- Releases completed skin-callback ownership when the callback finishes, rather than waiting for the VM to destroy its callback object. Unfinished native calls remain protected.
- Keeps the latest queued selection and skips superseded skin-query follow-ups. Adds queued, applying, and delayed status in the existing UI help line.

### Load safety, previews, and outfit correction

- Schedules automatic distribution, equipment changes, and rebuild recovery across actual engine update boundaries instead of repeatedly draining the same task queue.
- Prevents overlapping BCNG updates on the same actor. Cancels stale session work during loading and bounds retries for actors whose 3D is unavailable.
- Prevents another NPC's automatic distribution from cancelling the selected actor's body preview. Loading a save no longer confirms pending choices from the previous UI session.
- Coordinates RaceMenu-close recovery with outstanding actor work. Default body/skin requests no longer fall back to an older selected result while removal is pending.
- Refreshes outfit correction after body reapplication and calculates procedural correction against the combined morph result without deleting other mods' morph keys.

### Refresh and processing cost

- Detects changed XML/DDS content under the same preset or pack ID. Refreshing changed DDS content uses a new texture-cache identity so the previous cached file is not reused.
- Caches content signatures and read-only rule snapshots; avoids repeated full-catalog copies and unnecessary force-outfit inventory searches.
- Keeps full DDS reads at initial catalog loading or explicit refresh, not at each NPC event. Expensive post-apply texture audits remain debug-only.
- Preserves existing rules, settings, co-save identifiers, starter exclusions, body-family filtering, skin part/channel routing, and camera values.

### Validation

Release build and all 12 regression test executables passed. Automated tests cover queue ordering, callback lifetime/cancellation, latest-selection handling, catalog refresh, and existing routing/state rules. This release is not a confirmed fix for the reported OverlayFix CTD and does not certify stutter-free gameplay or in-game appearance.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-09-04

### Body presets and mixed-body installations

- Body presets now target an absolute shape across the compatible family's slider set. Omitted XML sliders target zero; repeated preview, confirmation, and NPC distribution no longer add the same shape on top of an existing one.
- Uses BCNG-owned compensation instead of globally clearing morphs. Other mods' morph keys are not deleted, and the preview and committed/NPC paths keep separate ownership.
- Detects CBBE 3BA and UBE per actor from the loaded skin/head evidence. Preset set and Group metadata drive XML classification; ambiguous and multi-family presets retain safe display fallbacks.
- Keeps user-selected rule pools intact; runtime body/skin selection checks the matched actor's sex and known family. Outfit-related names are not blanket-excluded from the body catalog.

### Skin coverage and material routing

- Corrects male skin-path handling and hand/foot targeting, including multi-slot skin armor whose geometry is not found through the first biped slot.
- Partial skin packs work in preview, confirmation, and NPC distribution. Only supplied body/hand/foot/face parts and diffuse, normal, subsurface, or specular channels are replaced; missing values keep the underlying texture without cross-part or cross-channel substitution.
- Adds per-actor UBE 2.0 Body/Head atlas routing and female/male Argonian and Khajiit skin matching, including matching tail geometry.
- Applies femaleold and humanoid race-specific face-normal files only to matching actors and only where files exist. Astrid/Afflicted-specific textures and tint-mask DDS inside BodySkin are excluded from body-skin application.
- Routes CBBE 3BA femalebody_etc_v2_1 to its shared vagina/anal atlas and BHUNP/UNP BakaUNP/VaginalAnalCanal2 to matching vagina/anal/canal geometry, separately from regular body textures.
- Supports optional SOS Smurf Average, VectorPlexus Regular, and VectorPlexus Muscular slot-52 textures from the skin pack's original SOS directory. Addon/race/elder variants follow the live material; Muscular uses the shipped Regular-channel inheritance where appropriate.
- Separates known UBE/conventional player tint packs while retaining safe fallbacks for uncertain family detection. Tint remains a player-only feature.

### NPC distribution and performance

- Adds keyword, class, and combat-style rule targets alongside existing conditions. Faction dropdowns include unnamed forms using EditorID/plugin/local-ID labels.
- Stores faction, race, keyword, class, and combat-style targets as plugin plus local FormID in schema 4. Existing schema-3 rules remain readable and are migrated on save.
- Preserves the eight starter exclusions: custom followers and elders of both sexes remain body-only exclusions; Argonians and Khajiit of both sexes remain skin-only exclusions.
- Coalesces automatic actor/equipment work in both normal and performance modes, defers RaceMenu partition updates, and skips unnecessary outfit-morph rebuilds. Performance mode adds an extra scheduling interval.
- Moves the first loaded-NPC pass out of the serialization/RaceMenu/overlay load-callback burst by two game-task turns. No recurring file scan or timer is added; catalog-derived slider sets are cached.

### Migration, UI, and release

- Repairs visible non-UBE RaceMenu .jslot files with obsolete BodyChange.esp face HeadParts after the legacy plugin is removed. Creates an adjacent backup and prefers the available High Poly Head target, otherwise the vanilla target; UBE custom-head presets are preserved.
- Renames the main catalog tabs to Body Presets, Body Skins, and Tint Masks; refreshes Korean and English release documentation.
- Retains existing settings, co-save identities, ownership namespaces, and the BodyChangeNGdistribution.json filename. Version 1.1.0 does not rename or reset them.

### Validation

Validation: Release build and ten regression test executables. File/NIF evidence and automated tests cover routing and state logic; in-game atlas appearance, collision behavior, OverlayFix crash compatibility, and stutter-free gameplay are not certified by these tests.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-09-02

First stable public release.

### Body

- Applies BodySlide presets through RaceMenu BodyMorph without replacing body
  meshes at runtime.
- Interpolates low/high-weight preset values using the actor's current weight.
- Detects the selected actor's body family conservatively and filters only the
  main Body tab. Uncertain or multi-family presets remain visible through safe
  fallbacks; NPC distribution pools are never auto-filtered.
- Keeps outfit-named presets such as Clothes, Outfit, Bikini, Armor, Cuirass,
  Dress, Panty, and Overalls visible. Only exact `-Refit` presets are reserved
  for outfit correction.

### Skin

- Applies persistent RaceMenu/NiOverride texture overrides independently per
  actor without editing NIF, Skin Armor, or equipment records.
- Supports body, hands, feet, face, vampire face, diffuse, normal, subsurface,
  specular, and compatible FaceGen detail textures.
- Tracks ownership precisely so cleanup removes only Body Change NG's keys.

### Player tint

- Adds player-only tint packs with automatic race-appropriate DDS selection.
- Supports independent color/opacity adjustment and restoration for every
  active supported tint layer.
- Restores the color swatch and detail picker together with the world tint.
- Reapplies the selected pack, detail edits, and restored original layers after
  RaceMenu rebuilds the player's tint arrays.

### NPC distribution and persistence

- Adds top-down, first-match body/skin rules for all NPCs, custom followers,
  elders, names, NPC base FormIDs, factions, plugins, and races.
- Allows Body and Skin to be distributed or excluded independently in one rule.
- Includes eight editable starter exclusions: custom followers and elders are
  body-only exclusions for both sexes; Argonians and Khajiit are skin-only
  exclusions for both sexes.
- Uses stable per-actor pool selection and stores evaluated actor results in the
  SKSE co-save. Global rules remain in
  `Data\SKSE\Plugins\BodyChangeNGdistribution.json`.
- Resolves persistent NPC identities across load-order changes and avoids full
  redistribution of unchanged actors on every load.
- Imports OBody distribution rules only through the explicit editor action.

### Outfit correction and randomization

- Corrects supported breast sliders while clothed, with a separate nipple
  correction toggle.
- Imports OBody NG outfit-name/plugin/FormID exclusions, forced corrections,
  and female/male outfit-specific preset mappings without modifying the source
  JSON.
- Resolves an outfit-specific mapping before current-body `-Refit`, sex-wide
  fallback, and procedural correction.
- Adds stable optional nipple and genital shape randomization.

### UI, input, and camera

- Adds scalable Korean, English, and Simplified Chinese ImGui UI for 1080p,
  1440p, 2K, and 4K displays.
- Adds mouse, keyboard arrows/WASD, and gamepad D-pad navigation with confirm and
  cancel actions; shortcuts are suspended while a text field owns focus.
- Supports native Korean IME input, Backspace, configurable modifier hotkeys,
  per-tab favorites, searches, resizable dropdowns, and resizable distribution
  panes.
- Uses one-click live selection, double-click confirmation without closing, and
  confirmation of the final live row when the window closes.
- Adds optional left/right third-person character presentation and tint close-up
  with deterministic FOV/zoom restoration.
- Opens unpaused with the character framed on the left and the main window
  anchored from screen center toward the right by default on a new
  installation; existing saved preferences remain unchanged.
- Keeps paused right-drag rotation camera-only to avoid FSMP stretching, uses
  SmoothCam's public camera-control API when available, and avoids additive FOV
  and pause-counter manipulation.
- Fixes post-processing/DLSS-dependent UI tone changes by moving engine camera
  refreshes out of the ImGui render pass.

### Reliability

- Uses `BodyChangeNG` consistently for the DLL, log, settings directory,
  distribution JSON, morph keys, texture-cache namespace, source targets, and
  release archives. Valid legacy `BodyChangerNG` settings and distribution
  files are migrated to the new paths, while old morph and texture-override
  ownership remains recognized so existing saves do not stack or leak state.
- Reapplies committed Body, Skin, and Tint state after RaceMenu closes, with
  generation checks that prevent superseded asynchronous work from winning.
- Coalesces equipment and actor work, stores ActorHandles instead of raw actor
  pointers, clears detached actor preview/apply state, and resets all transient
  state on a new save session.
- Ships a valid schema-3 starter JSON and README files in every user asset
  folder.
- Verified by the release build and nine regression test executables covering
  actor state, asset catalogs, body-family classification, hotkeys, outfit
  rules, path migration, preset parsing, runtime layouts, and skin-override
  ownership.

## Pre-release development history

The 0.1.x and 0.2.x archives were private validation builds used to stabilize
runtime application, persistence, Unicode input, distribution editing, camera
presentation, and cleanup behavior. Version 1.0.0 is the first supported public
baseline; no pre-release archive is required when installing it.
